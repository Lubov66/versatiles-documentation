# The Bigger Picture

## The Future of VersaTiles

VersaTiles aims to democratize map data and tools, making geographic information accessible to all.


## Core Values

The ethos of VersaTiles is based on the principles of openness and freedom, with a focus on empowering users and contributors. We believe in the power of open source software to drive collaboration and innovation.

This is achieved through:
- **Open Standards**: We promote openly documented protocols and formats to encourage interoperability and flexibility in mapping solutions.
- **Open Data**: We advocate for free access to geographic data and support initiatives that encourage information sharing to enrich public knowledge and innovation.
- **Open Source**: By developing VersaTiles in an open environment, we encourage collaboration, auditability, and adoption, fostering a diverse ecosystem of applications and users.
- **Prefer Free Over Open**: We prioritize free standards, data, and software whenever possible.


## Support

Maintaining the non-commercial ethos of VersaTiles while supporting ongoing development and infrastructure poses unique challenges. 
To address these challenges, we are actively seeking grants and forming partnerships to secure financial support for both development and infrastructure maintenance, ensuring the project's long-term viability. Additionally, we encourage the community and beneficiaries of VersaTiles to contribute code.


## Legal Entity

A crucial factor in the future growth of VersaTiles is determining the most appropriate legal entity to handle donations and financial transactions. This decision is essential for establishing a solid foundation for the project and enabling the receipt of donations.

The options being considered include:
- **Independent Entity**: Establishing VersaTiles as a standalone legal entity, providing full autonomy but with the responsibility of full organizational management.
- **Subsection of an Existing Foundation**: Integrating VersaTiles as a subsection within an established foundation or organisation, benefiting from existing infrastructures, such as legal and financial frameworks, while focusing on project development.
