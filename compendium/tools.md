# Tools

In our roadmap, we plan to develop a suite of useful tools aimed at enhancing the usability and functionality of web-based mapping solutions:

- [ ] **Editorial Tools**: A comprehensive suite of web-based tools designed specifically for newsrooms, enabling the quick creation of:
  - [ ] **Locator Map**: A streamlined tool for generating maps that pinpoint a single location with customizable labeling. Ideal for illustrating the site of local events such as demonstrations, emergencies, or incidents.
  - [ ] **Area Map**: Facilitates the creation of maps delineating areas with additional symbols (e.g., arrows) and annotations. This tool is particularly useful for visualizing large-scale impacts, such as restricted zones, areas affected by natural disasters, or military front lines.
  - [ ] **Points Map**: A utility for plotting numerous points on a map, sourced from data files (CSV, Excel) containing geocoordinates or addresses. Applications include mapping incidents like bicycle accidents, showcasing locations of interest such as Christmas markets, or indicating facilities like COVID-19 testing centers.
- [ ] **GeoJSON BBOX Tool**: A user-friendly web tool for selecting a bounding box (bbox) on a map and exporting the coordinates in various formats, simplifying the process of defining map extents.
- [ ] **Installer**: An web tool that provides customized installation instructions for setting up a map server for a selected region, tailored for multiple platforms like Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi and more.
- [ ] **Style-Maker**: A plugin for MapLibre designed to facilitate the customization of map styles, allowing users to modify colors, fonts, and language settings seamlessly. ([Repository](https://github.com/versatiles-org/maplibre-versatiles-styler))
- [ ] **Backend Renderer**: A JavaScript library engineered to render specified map regions into PNG or SVG formats, offering a flexible solution for static map generation. ([Repository](https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-renderer))
- [ ] **VersaTiles-Studio**: A desktop application, developed in Rust, that enables the conversion of geographic data into vector tiles while optimizing tile size.
- [ ] **Generate City Maps**: An interactive web demonstration of VersaTiles capabilities, allowing users to select a region and automatically generate a stylized city map poster in black and white. ([Examples](https://duckduckgo.com/?va=i&t=hb&q=city+map+poster&iax=images&ia=images))
- [ ] **Style Converter**: A NodeJS utility designed to convert map styles from the OpenMapTiles schema to the Shortbread schema.
